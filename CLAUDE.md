# Code quality
npm run lint           # ESLint check
npm run typecheck      # TypeScript validation
```

### Database Operations

```bash
npm run db:push        # Deploy schema changes to database
npm run db:generate    # Generate migration files
npm run db:migrate     # Apply pending migrations

```

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack Foundation

- **Full-stack TypeScript** with ES modules (`"type": "module"`)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite, Wouter for routing, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Express.js with session-based authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, comprehensive schema in `shared/schema.ts`
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for deal analysis, market insights, and lead qualification

### Core Business Domain

This is a **comprehensive real estate investment CRM** inspired by Pace Morby's subject-to community with:

- **Deal Management**: Complete deal pipeline from lead to closing
- **Property Analysis**: ARV calculations, repair estimates, profit projections
- **Investment Strategies**: Subject-to, seller financing, wholesale, BRRRR, fix & flip
- **Lead Management**: Multi-channel lead capture and nurturing
- **Client Portal**: Investor/seller communication and document sharing
- **Market Intelligence**: Comparable sales, market trends, automated valuations
- **Task Management**: Deal workflow automation and team coordination
- **AI Features**: Deal analysis, market insights, lead qualification

### Database Architecture

The schema (`shared/schema.ts`) implements a comprehensive real estate CRM with:

- **Core entities**: `clients`, `properties`, `deals`, `investmentStrategies`, `contracts`
- **Analysis tools**: `dealAnalysis`, `comparables`, `propertyImages`
- **Advanced CRM**: `leads`, `communicationLog`, `automationSequences`, `tasks`
- **Service management**: `serviceProviders`, `teamMembers`
- **Client engagement**: `clientPortalSessions`, `aiChats`

All tables use Drizzle ORM with proper relations and Zod validation schemas.

### Real Estate Client Types

- **Sellers**: Motivated sellers, distressed properties, inherited properties
- **Buyers**: Cash buyers, first-time investors, experienced investors
- **Investors**: Private money lenders, institutional investors, partners
- **Wholesalers**: Deal finders, bird dogs, assignment specialists
- **Service Providers**: Contractors, inspectors, appraisers, attorneys, title companies

### Investment Strategies Supported

- **Subject-To**: Taking over existing mortgage payments
- **Seller Financing**: Owner-financed deals with flexible terms
- **Wholesale**: Quick assignments for wholesale fees
- **Fix & Flip**: Renovation projects for resale profit
- **BRRRR**: Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat strategy
- **Lease Options**: Rent-to-own arrangements

### Authentication & Sessions

- Express sessions with cookie-parser for admin auth
- Client portal uses token-based access (`clientPortalSessions` table)
- CORS configured for development (localhost:5173) and production

### API Patterns

- RESTful endpoints under `/api/` prefix
- All routes defined in `server/routes.ts`
- Data access layer in `server/storage.ts` using Drizzle queries
- Comprehensive error handling with environment-aware responses

### Development Workflow

1. **Database First**: Schema changes in `shared/schema.ts`
2. **API Layer**: Update `server/storage.ts` and `server/routes.ts`
3. **Frontend**: Components in appropriate directories, API calls via `lib/api.ts`
4. **Always run** `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` before committing

### Environment Requirements

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For AI features (required)
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session security (defaults provided)
- `TWILIO_*`: SMS notifications (optional)
- `MLS_API_KEY`: For property data integration (optional)
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: For mapping and location services (optional)

### File Upload Handling

- Property images stored in `attached_assets/` directory
- Multer middleware for file processing
- Property images linked to properties and deals via `propertyImages` table
- Support for before/after renovation photos

### Production Deployment

- Supports Vercel (primary), Docker, and Render
- Static files served from `client/dist` in production
- Health check endpoint at `/health`
- Node.js 18+ required

## Development Guidelines

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Do not add your signature to commit messages

### File Management Guidelines

- Choose the most efficient approach - create new files if it's faster/easier than editing existing ones
- Actively remove unused files to keep the codebase clean
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

### Real Estate Terminology

- Use industry-standard terms (ARV, BRRRR, Subject-To, etc.)
- Maintain consistent terminology across UI and database
- Follow Pace Morby's methodology and terminology where applicable
- Consider both beginner and advanced investor needs
